        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          In a blender, blend the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. Transfer to a
          bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and mix with a spoon. Pour into cupcake liners placed in a large baking
          pan, side by side. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25 minutes or until cooked and golden. Remove and let
          cool.
          <br>
          <br>
          For the filling, heat all the ingredients over medium heat, stirring well until thickened. Turn off the heat,
          let it cool, and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Set aside. Place the whipped cream in a
          piping bag with a star tip and set aside.
          <br>
          <br>
          To assemble, make a hole in the center of each cupcake and fill it with the reserved coffee brigadeiro.
          Decorate the tops of the cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream, making circles. Garnish with coffee beans
          and refrigerate until ready to serve.
